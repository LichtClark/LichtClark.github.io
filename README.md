## Inspired by Github:
Thereforce you need to read the githubpages which explains how to use GitHub Pages sites and add your A Records with a DNS.
To get an active SSL-Certificate Github is not responsible for your SLL-Encryption, rather your DNS-provider does offer those services (creating one should be duty)
which you can activate then on your github Pages to get a Secured http connection.
