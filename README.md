Welcome to my Open-Source-Website hosted by GitHub and my DNS-Provider. I came up with this idea since I was trying to host on GitHub with my domain Records.
Shout outs to @ipv64.net
A null plus ultra was also that I would have to pay extra for storage hosting (custom HTML aot.) and I only want to pay nothing, which is a great deal in combination with an free SSL-Cert trough - [Cloudflare-DNS-Proxy](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-an-ssl-certificate/).

See following to reproduce: 

## Inspiration:
I got Inspired by the Github Documentition. Thereforce you need to read the githubpages which explains how to use GitHub Pages sites and add your A Records with a DNS.
To get an active SSL-Certificate Github is not responsible for your SLL-Encryption, rather your DNS-provider does offer those services (creating one should be duty since browsers dont trust only-http sites in 2022 anymore), which you can activate then on your github Pages to get a Secured http connection.
 - [Github Documentation about seting up DNS](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)

## Responsebillity:
This a open-source hosted website which provides Source-Code basements just for Research Education and Nothing else.
I won't be responsible for any harm or damage. Any action you take will get documented in a log file of a server. Keep that in mind. For further information please look at:  
- [Log System](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/logs.html)

THIS WEBSITE PROBABLY WILL END ITS DNS ON JANUARY 1ST 2023!
