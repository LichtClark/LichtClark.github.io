See following to reproduce: 

## Inspiration:
I got Inspired by the Github Documentition. Thereforce you need to read the githubpages which explains how to use GitHub Pages sites and add your A Records with a DNS.
To get an active SSL-Certificate Github is not responsible for your SLL-Encryption, rather your DNS-provider does offer those services (creating one should be duty)
which you can activate then on your github Pages to get a Secured http connection.
 - [Github Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)

## Responsebillity:
This a open-source hosted website which provides Source-Code basements just for Reseach Education and Nothing else.

THIS WEBSITE PROBABLY WILL END ITS DNS ON JANUARY 1ST 2023.!
