# test-seite-fuer-domain
Welcome to my Open-Source-Website hosted by GitHub and my DNS-Provider. I came up with this idea since I was trying to host on GitHub with my domain Records.
A null plus ultra was also that I would have to pay extra for storage hosting (custom HTML aot.) and I only want to pay â‚¬1/ 12-months, which is a great deal in combination with an SSL Cert.

See following to reproduce: 

## Inspiration:
I got Inspired by the Github Documentition. Thereforce you need to read the githubpages which explains how to use GitHub Pages sites and add your A Records with a DNS.
To get an active SSL-Certificate Github is not responsible for your SLL-Encryption, rather your DNS-provider does offer those services (creating one should be duty since browsers dont trust only-http sites in 2022 anymore), which you can activate then on your github Pages to get a Secured http connection.

## Responsebillity:
This a open-source hosted website which provides Source-Code basements just for Research Education and Nothing else.
I won't be responsible for any harm or damage. Any action you take will get documented in a log file of a server. Keep that in mind. For further information please look at:

THIS WEBSITE PROBABLY WILL END ITS DNS ON JANUARY 1ST 2023!
